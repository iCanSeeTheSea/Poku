## Rules and how to play

### Game set-up

each player is dealt 5 cards, and 7 cards are laid face down in the centre of the playing area

each player should start with an equal amount of [unnamed currency] - this quantity is yet to be decided

### The turn order

starting with a random player, and going round the players in a clockwise order, each player will bet any amount from their supply, in order to match the current highest bet, or raise the amount that players must match. (There is a minimum bet of 1 on the first round)

once all the players have either folded or matched the highest bet, and everyone who is still in has stuck with their amount, each player, in the same order as the betting, will have one opportunity to play as many round action cards from their hand as they wish. The effects these cards have are explained in the next section

after the first round, the first 4 cards are revealed. after the second round, the next 2 cards are revealed. after the third round, the final card is revealed. If any of the cards that are revealed are action cards, they are played instantly. Any cards added will be to the table, any card selection will be random, and round skip cards will not activate

### The cards

#### Number cards - 160

There are 4 sets of each colour = 160 cards

These cards will have a number from 0-9, and a colour of either red, green, blue or yellow. These cards are used to create hands, as explained below, based on their colour and number, and the relations they have to the other cards in play.

#### Action cards

These cards are discarded after being played

##### round skip

This card allows a player to remain in the game without betting in the next round if played at the end of the round, or for the rest of the current round if played in the middle of one. In any subsequent rounds, this player will only have to match the amount added to the total in that round.

### Hand rankings and ending a round

At the end of the game, each player's best hand is calculated. Hands can include any number of cards from 1 to 10 - Hands using more cards will have higher values than hands with less cards, regardless of their type's ranking. Some hands may have upper or lower limits to their size.

For hands of the same type and size, the hand including the highest number is better. If both hands have the same highest number, *that cards* colour will be ranked, in the order: red, green, blue, yellow. If both cards have the same colour, the next highest card of each player's hand is looked at. If both players have identical hands, then the player higher in the turn order will win. 

The player with the highest ranking round takes all of the currency bet by all the players

*Hand rankings will be added after possible hands are worked out*
